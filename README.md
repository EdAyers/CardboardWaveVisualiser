# What this app does
A Google Cardboard app using Unity that visualises concepts in physics. Currently in alpha.
Part of the [Isaac](isaacphysics.org) project

# How to build

1. [Get the latest version of Unity](http://unity3d.com/get-unity/download), installing the free edition is sufficient
2. [Get the android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Other), the 'SDK tools only' should be sufficient.
3. Git clone this repo to your favourite directory.
4. In the Unity start screen, tap 'open other' and navigate to the place you cloned to, hit 'select folder'. Unity should now open its editor for you to hack with.
5. To build, go to File > Build Settings and select your target platform. At the moment we have only tested on android so use that one.
6. Hit build, select a build location and when prompted for the location of the android SDK navigate to the place you downloaded the files in step 2 to. This should produce an APK file. Use 'Build and Run' to run on a physical device.
